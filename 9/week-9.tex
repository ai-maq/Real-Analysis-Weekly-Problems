	\begin{definition}[\(\varepsilon\)-Neighborhood]
		If \(\mathbb{F}\) is an ordered field, \(c\in\mathbb{F}\) then \(\varepsilon\)-neighborhood of \(c\); \(\aleph_{\varepsilon}(c)\) is defined as
		\[\aleph_{\varepsilon}(c):=\{x:x\in\mathbb{F}\land |x-c|<\varepsilon\}\]
	\end{definition}

	\begin{definition}[Neighborhood]
		A neighborhood of \(c\in(\mathbb{F},\mathbb{P})\) is any set \(S\subseteq\mathbb{F}\ni S\) contains some \(\varepsilon\)-neighborhood of \(c\) i.e. \(\exists \varepsilon>0\ni\aleph_{\varepsilon}(c)\subseteq S\).
	\end{definition}

	\begin{definition}[Nest] 
		A sequence of sets \(\{S_i\}=S_1,S_2,\cdots\), is called a Nest iff \[S_1\supseteq S_2\supseteq S_3\supseteq\cdots\]
	\end{definition}

	% \begin{definition}[Nested Interval Property]
	% 	A sequence of sets \(\{S_i\}=S_1,S_2,\cdots\), is called a Nest iff \[S_1\supseteq S_2\supseteq S_3\supseteq\cdots\]

\begin{questions}
	\question[1] Suppose \(U\) is a neighborhood of a point \(x\) and that \(U\subseteq V\). Show that \(V\) is a neighborhood of \(x\).
	\begin{solution}
		\(U\) is a neighborhood of \(x\) that means there exists \(\varepsilon>0\) such that \(\aleph_{\varepsilon}(x)\subseteq U\). Now, \(U\subseteq V\) means \(\aleph_{\varepsilon}(x)\subseteq V\). Therefore, \(V\) is a neighborhood of \(x\). \hfill\(\blacksquare\)
	\end{solution}

	\question[1] \begin{parts}
		\part Suppose \(U\) and \(V\) are neighborhoods of a point \(x\). Show that \(U\cap V\) is a neighborhood of \(x\).
		\begin{solution}
			\(U\) and \(V\) are neighborhoods of \(x\) that means there exists \(\varepsilon_{1}>0\) and \(\varepsilon_{2}>0\) such that \(\aleph_{\varepsilon_{1}}(x)\subseteq U\) and \(\aleph_{\varepsilon_{2}}(x)\subseteq V\). Now, \(x\in U\cap V\) we can define a \(\varepsilon'=\min\{\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2\}\ni\aleph_{\varepsilon'}(x)\subseteq U\cap V\) is an \(\varepsilon\)-neighborhood of \(x\). Therefore, \(U\cap V\) is a neighborhood of \(x\). \hfill\(\blacksquare\)
		\end{solution}

		\part Show that (a) remains true for a finite collection of neighborhoods.
		\begin{solution}
			\(\forall i\in\{1,2,\cdots,n\},U_{i}\) be neighborhoods of \(x\) then \(\exists\varepsilon_{i}>0\ni\aleph_{\varepsilon_{i}}(x)\subseteq U_{i}\). Now, \(\displaystyle x\in\bigcap_{i=1}^{n}U_{i}\), we can define a \(\displaystyle\varepsilon'=\min\{\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2,\dots,\varepsilon_n\}\ni\aleph_{\varepsilon'}(x)\subseteq\bigcap_{i=1}^{n}U_{i}\) is an \(\varepsilon\)-neighborhood of \(x\). Therefore, \(\displaystyle\bigcap_{i=1}^{n}U_{i}\) is a neighborhood of \(x\). \hfill\(\blacksquare\)
		\end{solution}

		\part Does (a) remains true for an infinite collection of neighborhoods?
		\begin{solution}
			Suppose \(\{U_i\}\) is a nest and that nest contains \(x\). By nested interval property \(\displaystyle\bigcap_{i=1}^{\infty}U_{i}\) is a neighborhood of \(x\). \hfill\(\blacksquare\)
		\end{solution}
	\end{parts}

	\question[1] \begin{parts}
		\part If \(S\) and \(T\) are bounded sets, show that \(S\cap T\) are bounded.
		\begin{solution}

		\end{solution}

		\part If \(S\) and \(T\) are as in (a), show that \(\sup \left(S\cup T\right)=\max \{\sup S,\sup T\}\) (be sure to justify use of \(\max\)).
		\begin{solution}
			If \(S\) and \(T\) are bounded, then \(\exists \sup{S},\sup{T},\inf{S},\inf{T}\in S\cup T\). There can only be two cases for supremum,
			\begin{align*}
				\sup{S}\le\sup{T} & \implies \sup{(S\cup T)}=\sup{T}\\
				\sup{S}>\sup{T} & \implies \sup{(S\cup T)}=\sup{S}
			\end{align*}
			If we put \(\sup{S}\) and \(\sup{T}\) in a set then we can say that,
			\begin{align*}
				\sup{S}\le\sup{T} & \implies \sup{\{\sup{S},\sup{T}\}}=\sup{T}\in\{\sup{S},\sup{T}\}\\
				\sup{S}>\sup{T} & \implies \sup{\{\sup{S},\sup{T}\}}=\sup{S}\in\{\sup{S},\sup{T}\}
			\end{align*}
			Because the supremum was in the set we can say that the supremum is the maximum of the set. Therefore, \(\sup{(S\cup T)}=\max \{\sup{S},\sup{T}\}\). \hfill\(\blacksquare\)
		\end{solution}

		\part Is it true that \(\sup\left(S\cap T\right)=\min\{\sup S, \sup T\}\)?
		\begin{solution}
			No, it is not true. Consider the set \(S=\{1,2,4\}\) and \(T=\{3,6\}\). Then \(\sup S=4\) and \(\sup T=6\). But \(\sup S\cap T=-\infty\). \hfill\(\blacksquare\)
		\end{solution}

		\part Give a condition under which the equality in (c) would be true.
		\begin{solution}
			The condition would be that either \(\sup{S}\in S\cap T\) or \(\sup{T}\in S\cap T\).
		\end{solution}

		\part Let \(\{S_\alpha:\alpha\in\mathcal{A}\}\) be a collection of bounded sets (where \(\mathcal{A}\) is finite). Show that \(\displaystyle\bigcup_{\alpha\in\mathcal{A}}S_\alpha\) is bounded.
		\begin{solution}
			Let \(\displaystyle S=\bigcup_{\alpha\in\mathcal{A}}S_\alpha\) be bounded, then \(\forall\alpha\in\mathcal{A},\exists \sup{S_\alpha}\land \inf{S_\alpha}\). Now, \(\displaystyle\sup{S}=\max\{\sup{S_\alpha}:\alpha\in\mathcal{A}\}\), similarly \(\displaystyle\inf{S}=\min\{\inf{S_\alpha}:\alpha\in\mathcal{A}\}\). Therefore, \(\displaystyle S\) is bounded. \hfill\(\blacksquare\)
		\end{solution}

		\part Let \(\{S_\alpha:\alpha\in\mathcal{A}\}\) be a collection of bounded sets (where \(\mathcal{A}\) is infinite). Is \(\displaystyle\bigcup_{\alpha\in\mathcal{A}}S_\alpha\) necessarily bounded?
		\begin{solution}
			No, it is not necessarily bounded. Consider the set \(\displaystyle S=\bigcup_{\alpha\in\mathbb{N}}\{\alpha\}\). Then \(\displaystyle\sup{S}=\max\{\sup{S_\alpha}:\alpha\in\mathbb{N}\}=\max\{\alpha:\alpha\in\mathbb{N}\}=\infty\). \hfill\(\blacksquare\)
		\end{solution}
	\end{parts}

	\question[1] \begin{parts}
		\part Suppose \(x_k\) is a real number for \(k=1,2,\cdots\), and there is a positive number \(\varepsilon\) so that \(x_k>\varepsilon\) for each \(k\). If \(B\) is any real number, show that there is a natural number \(n\) so that \(x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_n>B\).
		\begin{solution}
			
		\end{solution}

		\part Show that this need not be the case if we assume only that \(x_n>0\) for all \(n\).
		\begin{solution}
				
		\end{solution}
